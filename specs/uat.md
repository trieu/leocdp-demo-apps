## 1. Introduction
Product Desk is a next-generation platform designed to enhance user engagement in stock trading by integrating Customer Data Platform (CDP) for unified data management, Artificial Intelligence (AI) for personalized insights, and Gamification mechanics for motivational experiences. Inspired by successful models like Robinhood, the platform offers zero-commission trading, mobile-first interfaces, real-time market data, personalized challenges, reward systems, and social sharing incentives.

UAT is the final testing phase where end-users or representatives validate the system in a production-like environment to confirm it meets specified requirements. This plan focuses on stock trading core features, including user onboarding, trading workflows, gamification interactions, AI-driven recommendations, and satisfaction-enhancing elements.
